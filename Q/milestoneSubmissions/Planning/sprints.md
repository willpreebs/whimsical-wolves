# Sprints Planning

## Sprint 1
The Milestone of sprint 1 is to get the server component of the system built.
This includes player registration, matchmaking, banking and the TCP server creation
so that clients can connect. We also want to create the dummy player,
and basic authentication possibly. Also, saving information about the system can be done with JSON
files.

## Sprint 2
The milestone of this sprint is to have the core gameplay of Q game possible. The game board state,
and necessary mutations, and observations should be implemented. On top of that, the referee should
be able to take actions, making moves on the board and checking the legality of said moves

## Sprint 3
The milestone of this sprint is the completed game and system. Designing and implementing
the player-referee interface, and rendering the game are the goals of this sprint. If anything 
spills over from the first 2 sprints, this one has a bit less work in it for the sake of leaving some wiggle room
