# Self-Eval [14/20]

[-6] Did not indicate in question 8 of the self-eval where in your code explicitly says what is considered ill-behaved player and how the referee deals with it. Instead of a perma-link, you provided an actual explanation. 

# Programming [145/160]

[-5] Missing explicit purpose statement for the function that is informing all survivors of their winning/losing status. 

[-10] Missing purpose statement in Referee explaining how the referee discovers misbehaving players and how it throws them out.

# Design [10/30]

[-10] Missing change to referee for attaching observers.

[-10] Design Task does not describe how the user can inspect states at leisure as the assignment asks for. One way to do this is to have arrows or labeled buttons for going through visualized game states
